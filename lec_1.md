# Lecture 1 #

   The overview of the course:

* There are many types of algorithms such as: 
	* Non-personalized, content-based, collarborative.
* They emphasize collaborative and personal system.
*  Details are best re-used than re-created : *e.g. LensKit toolkit*

# What we need to think before
What are really recommended?:

* New items
* Re-recommened old ones
---
Dimensions of Analysis:

* Domain

* Purpose

* Recommendation context

* Whose Opinions

* Personalization Level 

* Privacy and Trustworthy

* Interfaces 

* Recommendation Algorithms
---
How does context influnece users:

* Do at the time of recom
* Context constrain the recommders

Whose opinions?

* Experts
* People like you
* Everybody

Personalization level?:

* Generic - Treat everyone as same
* Demographic - A target group
* Ephemeral - User's current activity while recommended
* Persistent - User's long time interest
 
How much privacy shall we given?

## Non-Personalized Summary ##

 * External Community data
 * Summary of Community Ratings

>People often reads reviews such as 4 or 5 stars, rarely 2 to 3.


   
##Collaborative Filtering Techniques:

* User-user
* Item-item
* Dimensionality reduction

Notes on evaluation:

* Accuracy of predictions
* Usefulness 
	* Correctness
	* Non-obviousness
	* Diversity
* Computational performance
